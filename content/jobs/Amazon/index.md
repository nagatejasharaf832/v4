- Upgraded an AWS Lambda Python service and integrated it into a code pipeline to better understand the Lambda service. This
  experience allowed me to explore the power and flexibility of this cloud-based computing service, and I gained valuable insights into how it can be used in various software development scenarios.

- Developed a pattern-matching algorithm using the Levenshtein distance and Metaphone algorithm. The algorithm can identify an
  error threshold between two English sentences and suggest potential corrections. This challenging project required a deep understanding of natural language processing, algorithms, and software development principles.

- Improved the system for matching words and names with similar sounds. This involved handling phonetic words and calculating the
  dissimilarity of strings in a sentence. This approach can help ensure that sentences are correctly parsed and understood, and it resulted in a more accurate and effective system for matching words and names with similar sounds.
