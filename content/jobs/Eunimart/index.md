- Worked as a Python and Node.js developer with hands-on experience in SQL, Linux, Git, and microservices frameworks.
  My expertise in these technologies has given me a strong foundation in software development principles and best practices, allowing me to design and implement effective solutions that meet the needs of my clients and stakeholders.

- Designed a microservices architecture and implemented orchestration and choreography models for an e-commerce platform.
  This involved breaking down the platform into smaller, independently deployable services that can be developed and maintained separately, resulting in a more flexible, scalable, and efficient system.

- Developed a database schema design for a marketplace microservice in our e-commerce platform. This involved designing and  
  implementing a database schema that can efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data, ensuring that the system can handle large volumes of traffic and transactions.

- Integrated various open APIs from Amazon, Flipkart, Bonanza, eBay, etc. into the platform to analyze new orders, products,  
  inventory, and pricing across all regions of the marketplaces. This involved working with various APIs to retrieve and process data, ensuring that the data is accurate, consistent, and up to date.

- Collected and analyzed product information from various marketplaces to determine competitive pricing of similar
  products for a seller in our platform.
